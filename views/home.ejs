            <h2>Coffee A Day</h2>
            <p>Time For Coffee, is India’s favourite hangout for coffee and conversations.we strive to provide 
            the best experience to our guests.Our coffees are sourced from thousands of small coffee planters, 
            who made us who we are today and we're glad to be a part of their lives. We opened our first cafe in 
            1996  the youth and the young at heart immediately took to the cafe, and it continues to be one of the 
            most happening places in the city. Time For Coffee to the youth is a “hangout” spot where they meet 
            people, make conversations, and have a whole lot of fun over steaming cups of great coffee.
            if your travel takes you there, do stop by our outlets to get a taste from back home or you can order
            within 10km distance from us!</p>
